The basic steps to using Evergreen's reporter are:

. Create a template. See xref:reports:reporter_create_templates.adoc[Creating Report Templates].
.. Alternatively, find a template and clone it into your folders if it was created by another user. See xref:reports:reporter_cloning_shared_templates.adoc[Cloning Report Templates].
. Run the report, also referred to as creating a report definition.
. View your output either through the staff client or via your email.

[[running_reports]]
== Running a Report ==

indexterm:[running reports, creating reports, reports]

You can run one-off reports on demand or schedule recurring reports to run automatically. To run the report, you fill out the reports form which creates a report definition, which tells Evergreen how to run the report, what information to include, and what type of output to provide you with.

. Navigate to *Administration -> Reports*.
. In the _My Folders_ section select the arrow beside the _Templates_ folder to see your template folders. Use the arrows to expand the folder tree until you find the folder containing the template you would like to use for your report.
+
image::reporter_basics/reports-run-1.png[Folder Tree]

+
image::reporter_basics/reports-run-4.png[Report Description]
+
. The display columns included in the output are listed as Report columns.
+
Pivot Label Column and Pivot Data Column are optional. Pivot tables are a different way to view data. If you currently use pivot tables to manipulate report data in Microsoft Excel, it is better to select an Excel output and continue using pivot tables in Excel. Please note that pivot tables are only suitable for some types of result data.
+

[[report_filters]]
=== Report Filters ===

indexterm:[report filters, reports]

The filters in a report template allow library staff to set the parameters on which the report runs. The
ability to select values for certain filters when running a report means a single report template can 
be used multiple times to generate reports on slightly different data. For example, the same report 
template can be used to generate separate lists of items using particular circulation modifiers.

[[hardcoded_filters]]
==== Hardcoded Filters ====

Hardcoded filters are set when the report template is created. These filters cannot be changed when 
running a report. Common hardcoded filters include:

[options="header"]
|===
|Column |Transform |Action |User Params |Description 
|Bibliographic Record -> Record ID |Raw Data |Not in list |-1 | Exclude all records where
the bibliographic record ID is -1 which is all pre-cat records.
|Call Number/Volume -> Call Number/Volume ID |Raw Data |Not in list |-1 | Exclude all records where
the call number ID is -1 which is all pre-cat records.
|Circulation -> Check In Date/Time |Date |Is NULL| |Include only items that have not been checked in.
|Circulation -> Circulating Item -> Copy Status -> Name |Raw Data |Equals | name of an item status | Include
only items that are in the specified item status.
|Circulation -> Fine Stop Reason |Raw Data |Not in list |LOST | Exclude items that have stopped generating
fines because they have been set to lost.
|Item -> Is Deleted |Raw Data |Equals |f | Include only non-deleted items.
|ILS User -> Is Deleted |Raw Data |Equals |f | Include only non-deleted patrons.
|===

[[report_date_filters]]
==== Date Filters ====

Date filters are generally set up to be a specific date, a specific month, or a date range. Date filters
may include tips about how the dates should be entered. For instance, in a date range, the earlier
date should always be entered in the first date box.

image::reporter_basics/reports-filters-1.png[Date Filters]

If you'd like to include all possible data for your library in a report that specifies a time range, 
enter between "1900-01-01" and "today's date".

When running recurring reports it's very important to use _Relative Dates_ in your filters. This will allow Evergreen to calculate the time period to report on each time it runs the report. A relative date of 1 month ago will generate a new report each month on the previous month's data; a real date of November 2022 will generate the same report each month with the data from November 2022. 

[TIP]
=====
You can set up recurring monthly reports to show comparative data from one year ago. To do this, select relative dates of 1 month ago and 13 months ago.
=====

Use the drop-down menu to switch from _Real Date_ to _Relative Date_. For a report filtering on month, you will be able to indicate how many months ago the report should look at.

image::reporter_basics/reports-filters-2.png[Relative Date Filter]

[[report_library_filters]]
==== Library Filters ====

All report templates used by libraries should include a library filter. This filter can look at the library specified in a variety of fields in the data including the checkout library, circulation library, owning library, patron's home library, and organizational unit.

image::reporter_basics/reports-filters-3.png[Select Library Filter]

This filter is important as it allows staff to restrict the data in the report output to only data relevant to their library.

Multi-branch libraries can add specific branches or all of their branches to the list to get a report including data from the select branches.

[[report_other_filters]]
==== Other Filters ====

While many filters will require staff to select values from a given list, some filters will require staff to type a value into the filter _User Params_ field. In those cases field hints or xref:reports:reporter_create_templates.adoc#changing_column_documentation[column documentation] can be used to indicate how the text should be entered so that Evergreen can use the value and generate usable report output.

image::reporter_basics/reports-filters-4.png[Field Hint for User Name]

Some report templates will have just hardcoded filters and a single library filter that requires staff to enter a value while other reports will have multiple filters where staff need to enter values for the library, dates, and patron or item data.

image::reporter_basics/reports-filters-5.png[Multiple Filters]

[[recurring_reports]]
=== Recurring Reports ===

indexterm:[recurring reports, reports]

Save time by scheduling recurring reports to run your regular reports automatically. Monthly circulation and patron registration statistics are good candidates for recurring reports.

Staff with access to the reporter can set up recurring reports to email a link to the password-protected report output to another staff member.

To set up a recurring report, follow the procedure in xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#running_reports[Running a Report], above, until you reach step 11 and then follow the steps below.
 
. Select the box for _Recurring Report_.
. Select your desired _Recurrence Interval_. Reports can run on a daily, weekly, or monthly interval.
+
[TIP] 
=====
The recurrence interval should correspond to the date filter. For example, if the template filters on a date instead of month, a recurring report running with a monthly interval may miss a day or capture an extra day's data. See xref:reporter_basics.adoc#report_date_filters[Date Filters] for more information on working with date filters on a recurring report.
=====
+
. Check the box beside the date and set the date of the first run of the report.
+
image::reporter_basics/reports-recurring-1.png[Recurring Reports]
+
[NOTE]
======
Best practice is to always set recurring reports to run in the early hours of the morning (1:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. server time).

Monthly recurring reports MUST be set to run on the 1st of the next month in order to capture all monthly data.
======
+
. Enter an email address to send the report completion notification to. By default this field will contain the email address saved in your staff account. Additional addresses can be added separated by a comma.
+
image::reporter_basics/reports-run-10.png[Email Output]
+
[NOTE]
======
The email will contain a link to the password-protected report output. Only staff members with permissions to view reports or full access to the reporter will be able to open the report output.
======
+
. Choose the Output folder you would like to save the report output in and then select *Save Report*.
+
image::reporter_basics/reports-run-11.png[Select Output Location]
+
. A pop-up appears confirming the report has been saved. Select *OK*.
. Unless you have set a specific run time the report will run right away. If your report has not completed after 15 minutes, please contact your Evergreen administrator.
. Once the report is complete you can view your output. See Viewing Report Output, below.
 
[[viewing_report_output]]
== Viewing Report Output ==

indexterm:[reports, report output]

Once a report is finished, the output is stored in the specified _Output_ folder and will remain there until deleted. Your system administrator may have a script that automatically deletes report output after a certain period of time. 

If an email address was included in the report definition, Evergreen will send an email containing a link to the password-protected report output. Only staff members with permissions to view reports or full access to the reporter will be able to open the report output in either the staff client or via the email link.

Unless you have set a specific run time, reports generally take a few minutes to complete depending on the size of the report. If your report still shows as pending in your output folder after 15 minutes, you may need to contact your system administrator.

[[maintainting_reports_data]]
== Maintaining Reports Data ==

indexterm:[reports, reports data]

Saved report templates will stay in the database forever unless deleted by the template owner. Check with your system administrator to determine whether report definitions and output are deleted on a scheduled basis. 

When a template or report definition is deleted, all the linked definitions and output files are also deleted. If you have shared your template and/or created a recurring report using your template, you will not be able to delete your template. This is why it is important for all users to clone templates into their own folders before running reports.

It is recommended that you download output you need to keep as CSV or Excel output and save it locally on your computer hard drive or a shared drive.

[[maintaining_reports_templates]]
== Maintaining Your Report Templates ==

indexterm:[reports, reports templates]

As Evergreen evolves from version to version, the database tables sometimes change and report templates should be periodically reviewed to ensure that they are running correctly and efficiently. It is especially recommended to review templates following an upgrade. You can check the create time of a template in the template folder grid.

image::reporter_basics/report-maintain-templates-1.png[Create Time]

If you are modifying existing templates or creating your own templates, it is recommended that you delete interim versions of the template created while working on the template. This makes it easier to be sure you are using the correct version of the template.

[TIP]
=====
System Administrators should periodically review the scheduled and common reports and shared templates to ensure consistent usage. And example of a report to show templates in use can be seen on the https://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=evergreen-reports:templates:reports[Evergreen Reports Wiki].
