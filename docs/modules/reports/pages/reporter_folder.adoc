indexterm:[reports, report folders, folders]

The folders pane in the reporter is divided into two sections:

* _My Folders_ which contains the folders created with your Evergreen account.
* _Shared Folders_ which contains folders shared with you by other users.

There are three main components used by the reporter which each much be stored in a separate folder:

* _Templates_ which tell Evergreen what fields to offer as filters and what columns to display in the results file.
* _Reports_ which tell Evergreen what values to filter on, how often to run the report, and what file formats to output the results in.
* _Output_ which is the final results file from Evergreen with the information from the database.

In order to work with templates, reports, and output in the reporter you must have at least one folder created under each component. See the next section on Creating Folders.

_Template_, _Report_, and _Output_ folders can be private (accessible only to the user who created the folder) or shared with other staff at the library or other libraries within your system or consortium who have reporter permissions. A shared folder is searchable using the _Search Templates_ feature by anyone with permissions to see that folder.

. If you wish to change the share scope for the folder, you must first hide the folder and then re-share it with the new share scope. See below for information on hiding folders.

[CAUTION]
=========
A shared subfolder must be created within a shared folder. The shared subfolder must have the same
share scope or a narrower share scope than the parent folder.

image::reporter_folder/report-share-folders-6.png[Nested Shared Folders]

Subfolders created within unshared folders or folders that are shared with a wider scope than the parent folder may result in folders not displaying at all.  

Please be cautious when creating shared subfolders.

section.
